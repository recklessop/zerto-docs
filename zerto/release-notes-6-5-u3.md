# Release Notes for Zerto Virtual Replication V6.5 Update 3

Zerto Virtual Replication is an IT Resilience PlatformTM to provide business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) in a virtual environment, enabling the replication of mission-critical applications and data as quickly as possible and with minimal data loss. When devising a recovery plan, these two objectives, minimum time to recover and maximum data to recover, are assigned target values: the recovery time objective (RTO) and the recovery point objective (RPO). Zerto Virtual Replication enables a virtual-aware recovery with low values for both the RTO and RPO. In addition, Zerto Virtual Replication enables protecting virtual machines for extended, longer term, recovery using Long Term Retention.
