# The Zerto Public GitHub Repositories

The Zerto Public GitHub Repositories are examples of the functionalities that can be achieved with the Zerto REST API. The most important thing to remember is that the code in these repositories are provided as-is, and Zerto Support does not support them.

## Using the Projects

Before using the projects make sure that you read all of the documentation here as well as the readme file included in each project.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any problems with the scripts in the Zerto Public GitHub repos you should open an Issue on that GitHub repository. The contributors to that repository will then be alerted and can respond accordingly.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to our repos. Contributing helps others who are use the code, and it helps you keep your coding skills sharp and helps to build your GitHub resume!

Before contributing please be sure to review the [Zerto Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ZertoPublic/Welcome-to-the-Zerto-Public-Github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
